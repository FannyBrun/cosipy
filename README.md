# Requirements
## Packages and libraries
####Python 3
Any Python 3 version on any operating system should work. If you think the reason for a problem might be your specific Python 3 version or your 
operating system, please create a topic in the forum. $LINK$ <br> Model is tested and developed on:
  * Anaconda Distribution on max OS 
  * Python 3.6.5 on Ubuntu 18.04
  * Anaconda 3 64-bit (Python 3.6.3) on CentOS Linux 7.4
  * Cluster Innsbruck

#### Needed Python modules (with an Anaconda installation, they might be already installed):
* xarray
* dask-jobqueue
* netcdf4
* numpy             (included in Anaconda)
* scipy             (included in Anaconda)
* distributed       (included in Anaconda) 

## Input
Some variables are optinal and for ussage it has to be specified in the config file.
### Dynamic 2D fields: 
|Variable|Short Name|Unit|Comment|

# Quick tutorial
## Preprocessing
COSiPY provides some utilities which can be used to create the required input file for the core run.
### Create needed combined static input file
The following is the example in the "data/static/" folder. If the procedure does not work for your study area, please try it first
with the example.
#### Required packages and libraries:
* gdal (e.g. in Debian-based Linux distributions package called gdal-bin)
* climate date operators (e.g. in Debian-based Linux distributions package called cdo)
* netCDF Operators (e.g. in Debian-based Linux distritutions package called nco)
#### Needed input files
* Digital elevation model (WGS84 - EPSG:4326)
* Shapefile of the glacier (WGS84 - EPSG:4326)

#### Procedure:
In the utilities folder, there is the script create_static_file_command_line.py. This script runs some commands in the command line.
That's is the reason that we can provide this script only for UNIX and MAC users at the moment. We are working on a version where no UNIX command
line is needed.
(create_static_file.py).<br>
The intermediate files 'dem.nc', 'aspect.nc', 'mask.nc' and 'slope.nc' are deleted automatically. First, try to run the script
and create the 'static.nc' file with the example 'n30_e090_3arc_v2.tif' (SRTM) and 'Zhadang_RGI6.shp'. If this works, try to change to
your DEM and shapefile and adjust the area to which you want to shrink the DEM. The input data have to be in Lat/Lon
WGS84-EPSG:4326 projection with the units degrees that the script works correctly. <br>
Run the script with:
```
python create_static_file.py
```
Hint: to reproject the DEM to EPSG 4326 (not needed for the example in the source code):
```
gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 dgm_hintereisferner.tif dgm_hintereisferner-lat_lon.tif
```
### Create input file with all needed static and dynamic 2D fields
#### Needed files and parameters
* static.nc file, created in the step above
* 1D fields of all required dynamic input files
#### Procedure:
There are two different preprocessing scripts in the utilities folder to create the needed gridded input data. One is especially designed for the
usage of csv file from a datalogger of an AWS station. This file is called aws_logger2cosipy.py with the corresponding configuration file 
'aws_logger2cosipyConfig.py'.<br> 
The 'csv2cosipy.py' script with the corresponding configuration file 'csv2cosipyConfig.py' is a more general file.<br>
Very important: For the aws_logger2cosipy.py version the temperature has to be in degree Celsius.<br> For the following example, you have to use 
the csv2cosipy.py file.<br>
For solar radiation, a model after Wohlfahrt et al. (2016; doi: 10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.05.012) is used. <br>
For air temperature, relative humidity and precipitation constant lapse rates, which have to be set, are used. <br>
Wind speed and cloud cover fraction kept constant for all gridpoint at on time step.<br><br>
The script needs:
* the input file; for example a Campbell Scientific logger file with all required dynamic input fields
* the file path (including the name) for the resulting COSIPY file, which will be used as input file for the core run
* the path to the static file, created in the step above
* the start and end date of the timespan

In the csv2cosipyConfig.py one has to define how the input variables are called in the CS_FILE. <br> 
For the radiation module, one has to set the timezone and the zenit threshold. <br> Furthermore, the station name has to be set, the altitude of the station, and the lapse rates for temperature, relative humidity and precipitation.<br>
If everything is set, configured and prepared, run the script:
```bash
python aws2cosipy.py -c ../../data/input/Zhadang/Zhadang_ERA5_2009_2018.csv -o ../../data/input/Zhadang/Zhadang_ERA5_2009.nc -s ../../data/static/Zhadang_static.nc -b 20090101 -e 20091231
```
The script takes all input timestamps which are in the -c input file. If you want only a specific period. The -b and -e option are optional:
```
python aws2cosipy.py -c ../data/input/Zhadang/Zhadang_ERA5_2009_2018.csv -o ../data/input/Zhadang/Zhadang_ERA5_2009_2018.nc -s ../data/static/Zhadang_static.nc

```
## Core run
### Changes config.py and set everything for your specific need. See in config options.
For the example just run:
```
python COSIPY.py
```
in the root folder of the source code. The example execute the model run for January 2009 and should take less than 10 minutes (approx 3 minutes or 1 minute with 4 cores).
## Evaluation

## Restart

## Postprocessing
Need the following python modules:
* 
In folder postprocessing. 
```bash
python plot_cosipy_fields.py -f $OUTPUT_FILE -d $POINT_IN_TIME_OF_INTEREST -t 1
python plot_cosipy_fields.py -h #for help
```
